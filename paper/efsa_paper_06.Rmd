# ABSTRACT
Regulation and public administration literatures suggest that endowing regulatory agencies with greater independence from political stakeholders increases the credibility of their policies. The insulation of agencies from direct political control is said to have a positive effect on external stakeholders’ perceptions about the time-consistency, impartiality, and expert-based quality of agencies’ regulatory outputs. Surprisingly, however, the effect of agency independence on stakeholder perceptions of credibility has not been directly empirically tested. In this paper, we put the theory to rigorous empirical testing. We also challenge this rationalistic assumption theoretically. We suggest that policy credibility depends not only on agencies’ institutional insulation, but also on the extent to which the policy is consistent with stakeholders’ prior beliefs and positions on the policy matter. Focusing on food safety regulation in the EU and the case of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), we examine these theoretical expectations using a survey experiment with regulatory stakeholders. We test whether emphasizing the agency’s independence from political stakeholders increases the credibility of the agency’s risk assessment of pesticides, while accounting for stakeholders’ prior positions on pesticides’ safety. We find evidence that independence increases the perceived impartiality of regulatory outputs, but not other key aspects of their credibility – i.e. their expert-based quality and stability (time-consistency). At the same time, we find evidence that the credibility of regulatory outputs is greatly influenced by stakeholders’ prior positions. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for (EU) regulatory governance.

# INTRODUCTION
Regulation and public administration literatures suggest that the credibility of regulatory policy is strongly determined by agency independence from politics. Agency independence (or insulation) from direct political control is said to enhance the time-consistency of regulatory commitments and accordingly the credibility of regulatory policy [@shepsle1991discretion; @levy1996regulations; @majone1994rise; @majone1997new; @keefer2003limits; @gilardi2002policy; @gilardi2007same]. This established wisdom is a key claim at the heart of regulation literature and has been a main driver behind the rise of non-majoritarian agencies, operating at a distance from political controls. Premised on the virtues of “keep[ing] the regulators at arm’s length from their political masters” [@jordana2011global, 1344], the independent agency model has become the dominant model for organising regulation: we have thus, witnessed “a global diffusion of regulatory agencies” with the agency model emerging as ‘the “appropriate model” of governance across countries and sectors’ [@jordana2011global]. 

This is true not only with regard to economic regulation but for also for social regulation domains [@jordana2011global]. In the European Union for instance, credibility has been the main rationale behind the creation of EU agencies [@majone1996temporal; @majone1997new]. And as EU economic regulators were late-comers—i.e. powerful economic regulators were only recently set up at the EU level in the aftermath of the financial crisis (Thatcher 2010)— the credibility logic, foundational to the rise of the EU regulatory state, has been especially influential with respect to social regulators in this context. For instance, the establishment and the institutional design of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) were strongly predicated on institutional independence [@groenleer2009autonomy; @busuioc2013european] as a way to secure regulatory credibility and trust in the aftermath of a series of food crises linked to politicization. 

Surprisingly, however, the assumption that greater independence increases credibility has not been directly examined. The literature has focused mostly on measuring and/or explaining variations in agency levels of (de jure and de facto) independence [@gilardi2002policy; @gilardi2005formal; @gilardi2009delegation; @maggetti2007facto; @maggetti2012regulation; @hanretty_2012, @hanretty2013shall; @elgie2005credible; @wonka2010credibility], largely taking for granted the effect of the latter on credibility. The few studies that have directly tackled the independence- credibility argument are observational, report mixed findings, and importantly, do not directly assess the relation between *independence* and *credibility* as such [@bertelli2008credible; @bertelli2009perceiving; @overman2017autonomous]. 

The lack of direct empirical testing is surprising given that the setup of regulatory agencies as insulated building blocks of the regulatory state has considerable implications, amounting to a “a new division of power between politicians and bureaucrats within the administrative state” [@jordana2011global, 1344] and a significant “shuffling around of the institutional furniture of the state” [@lodge2008regulation, 282]. It also necessarily has far-reaching implications for the nature of liberal democracy, given the increased prominence of non-majoritarianism and the rise of associated ‘democratic deficit’ problems and constitutional concerns [@scott2000accountability; Scott 2010??; @lodge2004accountability; @curtin2009executive; @maggetti2010legitimacy]. Given the comprehensive nature of this development as well as the broad and fundamental nature of its repercussions, it is crucial to test the purported independence-credibility relationship.

This is precisely the main aim of this study. We aim to put this fundamental theoretical assumption to rigorous empirical testing. In addition, we also challenge the assumption theoretically. The assumption is based on the rationalistic logic that controversial areas can be depoliticised by fiat. By contrast, we suggest that stakeholders’ inclination to perceive agencies’ decisions as credible will depend not only on agency institutional insulation, but also, and perhaps even to a greater extent, on the extent to which these decisions are consistent with stakeholders’ prior beliefs and positions on the matter. Congruently, we suggest that stakeholders are likely to be skeptic about the quality and the motivation of regulatory  outputs that contradict their positions, despite them being produced by independent bodies. 

To explore these assumptions empirically, we designed and conducted a survey experiment with stakeholders of a non-majoritarian agency. This allows us to zoom in and directly test the purported causal mechanism at stake. The experiment focuses on the case of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), an independent regulatory agency at the EU level. The study was conducted among a population of 220 external stakeholders of the agency ranging from NGOs and advocacy groups, industry organisations, professional organizations engaging in research, low and consultancy firms and others.

# AGENCY INDEPENDENCE AND REGULATORY CREDIBILITY
Policy credibility is said to be a key rationale for the creation of independent regulatory agencies [@majone1996temporal; @majone1999regulatory; @gilardi2002policy; @gilardi2005formal]. Seminal literature has long emphasized the need for institutional commitment devices to signal policy stability  to market actors, from a rational, economic perspective [@kydland1977rules]. Politician’s preferences are said to be time inconsistent with a negative impact on policy continuity [@kydland1977rules; see also @majone1996temporal]: “without a binding commitment holding them to the original plan, governments will use their discretion to switch to what now appears to be a better policy” [@majone1996temporal, 3]. The anticipation of such shifts from the agreed course of action will necessarily have a dampening effect on investment. These concerns were said to be particularly emphasized in areas of economic regulation such as utilities which are particularly vulnerable to politicisation [@levy1994institutional; see also @gilardi2002policy; @gilardi2009delegation]. Characterised by large sunk investments and a broad range of domestic users—broadly equivalent to the electoral population— privatized utilities are especially prone to ex post political intervention and administrative expropriation [@levy1994institutional; see also @majone1999regulatory]. This gives rise to the need for institutional commitment devices to signal credibility to market actors. Delegation to independent, non-majoritarian agencies amounts to such a commitment device [@shepsle1991discretion]: “the institutional expressions of the ‘regulatory state’ as diagnosed by Majone and others are explained as strategic choices to signal ‘credible commitment’ to private investors” [@lodge2008regulation, 284]. 

The ‘independence-credibility thesis’ has been highly influential well beyond the realm of economic regulation, with regulation scholars pointing out that the need for time consistency is a general regulatory issue that pertains to economic and social regulation alike: “[D]emocratic politicians have few incentives to develop policies whose success, if at all, will come after the next election”, leading to “short-termism” and producing “harm when the problems faced by society require long-term solutions” [@majone1999regulatory, 4]. And reiterated: “Time inconsistency is clearly a general phenomenon”, pointing at “its significance for all areas of policy-making” [@majone1996temporal].  

In the same breath, and relatedly, authors have simultaneously also emphasised that the creation of non-majoritarian agencies, through their separation from ministerial hierarchies and political intervention, will lead to credible policies guided by *technical/expert-based rationale* as opposed to *short-term (myopic) political motivations*. Credibility in this sense refers to policies that, by virtue of their *shielding from politics* and *technical/expert basis*, are long-term in their outlook. This signals a broader understanding of regulatory credibility, which pertain not only to policy commitment across time (policy stability) but also to a commitment to “a particular kind of decision-making” [@greasley2014credibility]. Accordingly, in addition to its commitment for *stability (time consistency)*, a regulatory policy is said to be credible inasmuch as it fulfills two additional commitments: First, that it is not motivated or swayed by political (opportunistic) considerations or special interest influences (hereafter: *political non-interference*). Second, that it grounded in expertise, in adequate professional decision-making processes, which further ensure the credibility of the policy. This entails the use of adequate scientific evidence-based methods, and the effective analysis of all relevant data and evidence (hereafter: *expert-based*). In line with this understanding and to ensure that we capture the full breath of the concept, we define regulatory credibility as pertaining to all these three related sub-dimensions of a regulatory output, which we label: *stability, political non-interference and expert-based*.

The credibility logic has been particularly influential in the European regulatory state [@majone1999regulatory]. At the EU levels, arm’s length agencies were set up to remedy “the credibility crisis of Community regulation” stemming from “the growing politicization of the Commission” [@majone2000credibility, 275]. Interestingly however, in this context, the  credibility crisis became manifest in social regulation: “[t]his credibility crisis of Community regulation is symbolized by the recurrent food scares” [@majone2000credibility, 275]. Agency creation has thus, been justified by the European Commission in core policy documents with reference to their independence, which ensures their impartiality and professional quality: “The *independence of their technical and/or scientific assessments* is, in fact, *their real raison d’être*. The main advantage of using the agencies is that their decisions are based on *purely technical evaluations of very high quality and are not influenced by political or contingent considerations*” [@communication2002operating: 5, emphasis added]. The Commission has re-iterated throughout the years that for agency decisions to acquire “extra credibility and authority” requires “agencies helping to demonstrate that decisions are based on technical/scientific grounds” [see @communication2008way, 5].  

Yet, while the credibility-independence logic has been heavily influential and has fundamentally shaped regulatory practice and the shape of our regulatory institutions, the assumption remains untested. Extant studies geared at studying the credibility argument have not directly tested the causal relationship between independence (and perceptions thereof) and credibility. Rather, they only examined the correlations between structural disaggregation from Ministries, and available proxies of regulatory credibility – citizen satisfaction or perceptions of regulatory quality. 

@bertelli2009perceiving’s cross-national study “on the role of independent regulators in enhancing credibility” finds that “independent regulators substantially improve perceptions of national regulatory quality by business elites” (519). In other words, independence (based on a binary operationalization for independence) is associated with enhanced perceptions of regulatory quality. While the findings are consistent with the credibility thesis, they do not directly test it: The authors assume that the determined impact of independence on perceptions of regulatory quality “is rooted in this notion of credibility” [@bertelli2009perceiving], but do not directly measure the perceived independence and perceived credibility to be able to examine this relationship.

By contrast to the positive relations found by @bertelli2009perceiving, in his cross-national study @overman2017autonomous “did not find evidence for the credible commitment argument” (Ibid, 223). To interrogate the credibility argument, the study focuses on studying the relationship between agency independence (tax agencies and police) and citizen satisfaction, assuming that citizen satisfaction (if observed) works though credible commitment. Like @bertelli2009perceiving, he uses a binary distinction between formally independent agencies and non-disaggregated structures. Contrary to expectations, the author does not find that independence is associated with higher citizen satisfaction but notes that this could be due to the lack of the assumed credible commitment effect in the examined cases. Again, while speaking to the credibility argument, here too, the study does not directly interrogate the relationship between independence and credibility.

On the basis of the above, we put to test the common wisdom assumption of regulation literature: 

*H1 - The more (less) stakeholders perceive a regulatory agency as independent from political stakeholders, the more (less) they are likely to perceive its regulatory outputs as credible.*

<br>

# CREDIBILITY IN CONTESTED ENVIRONMENTS: CHALLENGING THE RATIONALITY ASSUMPTION
The assumption above reflects a broader emphasis at the heart of regulation literature more broadly, on rationality as a guiding principle of regulatory action and behavior—the belief in the promise of removing regulation from ‘messy politics’ into the domain of rational, expert-based decision-making. @lodge2008regulation [p. 286] characterizes the regulatory state account as essentially: “the diagnosed advocacy of regulation as a presumably technocratic and professional method of controlling social processes vis-à-vis the ‘dirty’ world of politics and business.” 

As @roberts2011logic [p. 141] has noted however: “There is an assumption buried here…that some topics and organizations can be made non-political…What evidence is there that it is actually possible to place certain subjects above politics?” We theoretically challenge the rationalistic assumption at the heart of regulation literature. While a regulatory body can be rendered institutionally-insulated, when the field of operation is controversial/salient (when the agency’s mandate pertains to regulating controversial issues), the agency’s regulatory outputs will likely *still* remain politicised, or at least perceived as such. In other words, policy areas do not become de-politicised at will, through the creation of an independent non-majoritarian regulator: “depoliticization does not make political pressures magically disappear, in the manner that a conjurer sublimely dupes his or her audience into believing the glamourous assistant have vanished into an empty box.” [@flinders2015politics]. More likely “[s]uppressing political contestation in one arena simply leads to its emerging elsewhere” [@chalmers2005risk, 650]. 

In fact, our argument is that regulatory audiences’ expectations and assessments of the credibility of the regulatory outputs will necessarily be coloured by partisan/ideological expectations of what constitute good or desirable outcomes, particularly so in the contested arena of regulatory policy. Qualitative empirical insights for instance, report ongoing controversy of regulatory outputs of agencies operating in disputed, salient areas despite institutional depolicisation, for instance, European agencies on topics such as GMOs or food additives [@groenleer2009autonomy]. 

Therefore, contrary to the mainstay assumption in the literature, we expect that perceived credibility will also be heavily shaped by stakeholder prior beliefs of desirable regulatory policy in the respective areas. In other words, we expect that perceptions of credibility will depend on the degree to which regulatory outcomes are consistent with stakeholder ideological preferences. When policy outcomes align with stakeholders’ prior positions, stakeholders are likely to perceive these as impartial, grounded in expertise, and time-consistent. By contrast, when the regulatory outcome is at odds with prior positions, stakeholders may view it as not credible. 

This expectation also finds support in behavioral research on motivated reasoning. That body of research has established that peoples’ motivations and goals unconsciously shape the ways in which they process new information and reason about relevant policy issues [@taber2006motivated; @lodge2013rationalizing; @kunda1990case]. Individuals tend to accept information and arguments that fit with their prior beliefs and give them greater weight, whereas they tend to contest and diminish evidence inconsistent with their prior beliefs. These psychological biases are instrumental for protecting peoples’ positive self-conception and rationalizing their behavior and predetermined positions, while maintaining an “illusion of objectivity”. Importantly, this mechanism is not limited to lay people, and also applies to knowledgeable professionals, experts and academics, most prominently in contested areas dividing people to different ‘camps’. In the public administration literature, multiple experiment-based studies have demonstrated that prior beliefs about policy issues bias citizens’ and policymakers’ interpretation of ‘objective’ performance information, and accordingly, their evaluation of agencies and policies  [@baekgaard2017role; @baekgaard2016interpreting; @christensen2018elected; @christensen2018biased; @james2016motivated; @jilke2018citizen].  

Our expectation is further lent support by research into independent ad-hoc crisis inquiries, and the acceptance of their reports by citizens [@sulitzeanu2006if; @sulitzeanu2016form]. SSimilar to the abovementioned assumption of regulation literature, the legitimacy of these institutions is presumed to be achieved via assigning them institutional attributes, which ensure their political independence, objectivity and neutrality (e.g. the appointment of a judge as the head of the inquiry, and granting him/her a discretion to select the other members). Yet, this research finds that citizens tend to perceive these inquiries’ reports as more legitimate, the more their outcomes are aligned with citizens’ prior preferences (“conditional credibility”). These studies show, both experimentally and observationally, that outcome of inquiries plays a much greater role in shaping their legitimacy than their institutional attributes. 

Thus, we hypothesize that: 

*H2 - The more (less) congruent is a regulatory output with stakeholders’ prior positions, the more (less) they are likely to perceive it as credible.*

<br>

# METHODOLOGY
We empirically examine these hypotheses in relation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). We conducted an experiment, embedded in a survey among external stakeholders of EFSA, as detailed below. The employment of an experimental design enables us to rigorously examine the causal effects of perceived independence and prior standpoints on regulatory credibility. At the same time, by surveying real stakeholders about actual regulatory outputs of the agency, we substantiate the study’s generalizability to real-world settings.

While experiments have been widely used by public administration scholars in recent years to explore the perceptions of citizens and political representatives about public sector agencies [@baekgaard2015conducting; @grimmelikhuijsen2017behavioral; @jilke2016generating; for a systematic review of experimental studies in public administration see: @li2017systematic], to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to experimentally examine the factors that shape the perceptions of a broad array of stakeholders regarding agencies’ scientific regulatory outputs. In addition, this is the first study to manipulate agencies perceived independence from political stakeholders. In the following section, we provide background on the empirical case. Thereafter, we describe the population of survey respondents and their selection and recruitment, the course of the survey and experimental procedures, and the operationalization of our main variables.


<br>

## *European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and pesticides regulation*
We put the assumption to test in a crucial case—the case of the European Food Safety Agency. EFSA is an independent, non-majoritarian agency, operating at the EU level, a separate institutional body from the EU institutions and the member states, with its own staff and budget. The agency is the product of a credibility crisis, part of the reform process of European food safety regulation, in response to a set of damaging food scandals in the late 1990s, linked to the politicization of regulatory policy. The agency’s creation in 2002 formally signaled the separation of scientific risk assessment, carried out by EFSA, from risk management, carried out by the European Commission. The separation of science from politics was seen as critical in order to rebuilt public confidence in the European regulatory food policy after the BSE and dioxin crises in particular [@vos2000reforming; @groenleer2009autonomy; @busuioc2013european]. 

In light of the circumstances surrounding its creation, EFSA’s set up is strongly predicated on its independence from politics and this logic is heavily reflected in the agency’s structures: “There are few EU organisations that can claim as much formal autonomy as EFSA” [@groenleer2009autonomy, 181]. In contrast to other EU agencies, where management boards are overwhelmingly made up of national representatives (one representative for each member state), EFSA’s 15-member governing board is exceptionally appointed *in a personal capacity*. Moreover, to further ensure separation from political considerations, EFSA’s scientific committee and panel members are independent scientists that are not nominated by national authorities of the member states. Again, this is in contrast to other European agencies— (e.g. the European Medicines Agency) where scientific committees contain members nominated by member states and the agency financially compensates national authorities for scientific work carried out for the EU agency [@groenleer2009autonomy].

EFSA’s mandate pertains to both risk assessment and risk communication and covers the areas of food and feed safety, nutrition, animal health and welfare, plant protection and plant health. In its risk assessor role, EFSA produces scientific opinions, which are adopted into biding decisions by the risk manager, the European Commission. The agency’s broad mandate covers areas that are heavily politicised in the European context such as the regulation of GMOs, pesticides or food additives. 

In light of the above, this renders it an especially relevant case to study the link between independence and credibility in contested environments. EFSA is a crucial case [@eckstein1975case; see also @gerring2016selecting], one that “must closely fit a theory if one is to have confidence in the theory’s validity” [@eckstein1975case], for the independence–credibility assumption. The pesticides case is especially relevant to study the impact of independence on perceptions of credibility. Pesticide regulation is a highly salient area, subject to much controversy with strong stances on (different sides of) the matter from the pesticide industry, green groups, farmers, organic industry and EU citizens at large. For instance in 2017, over 1,300,000 European citizens signed a petition to ban glyphosate, the world’s most widely-used herbicide, at the time up for regulatory assessment for the approval of its licence renewal. Following the controversy over glyphosate’s approval, EFSA’s executive director, Bernard Url, has publicly expressed his concern that advocacy organizations tend to judge EFSA’s scientific opinions selectively, depending on the extent to which scientific findings conform to their ideological stances: “We at EFSA believe that some campaigners are unwilling to accept any evidence that certain regulated substances are safe, and will tout weak scientific studies showing the opposite. The same groups applauded EFSA for reviews on other pesticides, such as neonicotinoids, that it deemed dangerous. It seems to us that some campaigners contest the science of safety assessments in pursuit of greater political arguments…" [@url2018don, 381]. Overall, over the years, EFSA has been criticized for its scientific opinions – as not precautionary enough or as overly-precautionary— by different pro and against ‘camps’ on a variety of regulatory issues and substances  [e.g. @groenleer2009autonomy; @rimkute2018organizational; @carrington2018eu; @carrington_website_2019].

## *Data collection*

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=F}
n.invitations = 654
n.errors = 46
n.invitations_effective = n.invitations-n.errors

n.start = efsa_00 %>% nrow()
n.reach_credibility.pest = efsa_00 %>% drop_na(credibility.pest.index) %>% nrow()
n.reach_independence = efsa_00 %>% drop_na(independence.polit.efsa) %>% nrow()
n.reach_end = efsa_raw %>% filter(Q13.13 !=0)%>% nrow()

```

We constructed a list of names, organizational affiliation and contact details of potential stakeholders of EFSA, based on a number of sources. First, to identify the relevant stakeholders, we relied on the *EU Transparency Register* (http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister), which includes information on more than 10,000 organisations representing particular interests at EU level [@jointtransparencyregistersecretariat_2019]. The register’s information is updated annually by the organizations themselves, and includes contact details of their “person with legal responsibility” and “person in charge of EU relations”. To restrict the list to potential stakeholders of EFSA, we filtered the dataset based on organizations’ self-reporting of their goals, activities and fields on interest. This search yielded a list of 3,155 persons from 2,045 different organizations related to the domains of ‘food and agriculture’, including representatives of the industry, NGOs and advocacy groups, professional organizations engaging in research, law firms and consultancy groups. We then supplemented this list, with EFSA’s list of “registered stakeholders” and lists of stakeholders  that attended over the years EFSA meetings with stakeholders, both obtained from EFSA’s website. The latter sources, which were obtained from EFSA’s website, included 392 persons from 259 organizations.[^footnote_construction_lists]

[^footnote_construction_lists]: All sources were downloaded on November 2018.   

For the stakeholders retrieved from the transparency register, we conducted an automatic search to retrieve their email addresses by web-scrapping their organizations’ official websites, and matching the found email patterns with participants’ names and initials.[^footnote_email.scraping] Through this method, we retrieved email addresses of 425 stakeholders (`r ((425/3155)*100) %>% round(0)`% of total names in the list). As for the list of participants in EFSA meetings and consultations, we conducted both automatic and manual online searches, through which we managed to retrieve emails of 229 stakeholders (`r ((229/392)*100) %>% round(0)`%). 

[^footnote_email.scraping]: The codes will be available online at the project's website.

The survey was conducted online through Qualtrics Survey Software. Between February-May 2019, we sent a total of `r n.invitations` email invitations with anonymous links to the survey, followed by three reminders. We contacted stakeholders from a university email address, and invited the stakeholders to fill in the anonymous survey. We also asked them to invite other executives and staff members in their organizations to fill out the survey. Importantly, to avoid priming them about food policy and mitigate potential selection bias, we did not directly inform them about the study’s focus on EFSA and food regulation. Rather, we generally presented it as an expert survey on regulatory policy at the EU, while noting that participants are asked about a specific regulatory policy area, in their case - food safety. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=F}

pwr.80 <- pwr.t.test(power = 0.8,
           n=n.reach_independence/2,

           sig.level = 0.05)

pwr.d.35 <- pwr.t.test(#power = 0.8,

           sig.level = 0.05)

```

In total, `r n.start` people started filling the survey, and `r n.reach_independence` completed the main part of the survey, which represent a sizable response rate of roughly `r (n.reach_independence/n.invitations_effective*100)%>% round(0)`%.[^footnote_response.rate] The median time for completing the survey was `r median(efsa_00$timer,na.rm = T)` minutes. Given the sample size, we estimate that a main effect of `r (pwr.80[["d"]] %>% round(2))` SDs for the experimental manipulations is detectible (power = 0.8).[^footnote_power] More than half of the respondents (`r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(age>=50) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(age) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`%) are older than 50 years, `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(female==0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(female) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% are men and `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(education %in% c("3 Master","4 Doctorat")) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(education) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% have a Master or Doctorate degree. `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="1-industry") %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(organization.type.short) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of respondents reported working in a company or a trade association, and `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="2-ngo") %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(organization.type.short) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% in an NGO. The demographic and organizational characteristics of our sample of respondents are summarized in the supplementary appendix. 

Our data also confirms that most of the respondents can be regarded as EFSA stakeholders. `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.area.food==1) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(organization.area.food) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of respondents identified the policy domain of "food and agriculture" as most relevant to the operations of their organization, `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(informed.efsa>0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(informed.efsa) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% indicated that they are relatively informed about EFSA's mandate and `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(affect.decisions.efsa>0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(affect.decisions.efsa) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% reported that EFSA’s decisions may affect the operations of their organization.[^footnote_relation.efsa] Furthermore, `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(str_detect(interact.efsa,c("2.|3.|4.|5."))==T) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(interact.efsa) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% reported that their organization interacts with EFSA at least once a year. Overall, we believe that our respondents represent a relatively diverse sample of external stakeholders of EFSA. 

[^footnote_response.rate]: To estimate response rate, we divided the number of observations by the number of invitations while subtracting the email addresses that returned automatic error messages (*n*=45). However, since some of the respondents received the invitation from other participants rather than directly by us, the exact response rate may be somewhat lower.   


[^footnote_power]: We conducted power calculations through r `pwr` package. Power estimates refer to significance level of 95% in a Two-sample t-test with directional hypothesis.  

[^footnote_relation.efsa]: The last two factors were measured through a -5 to 5 Likert scale. We regarded those who selected a score higher than 0.

## *Procedure*
Consistent with the email invitation, the questionnaire was introduced to the participants as an expert survey related to an academic study on regulatory policy at the EU level.[^footnote_additional_parts] The survey started with a set of pre-manipulation questions about respondents’ organization, and their perceptions of EU political institutions, and seleced regulatory agencies.[^footnote_credibility.pre] We then asked respondents a set of questions aimed at assessing their prior positions about food safety regulation, and pesticides in particular. To disguise our focus on food policy, we framed this section as questions about new technologies, and the opportunities these bring versus the threats they pose. We included in this section questions about technologies related to food, as well as to other policy domains. To further avoid priming, we then asked the respondents three additional questions regarding the use of machine learning algorithms in decision-making, in line with the abovementioned frame. 

[^footnote_additional_parts]: The survey was also designed to explore the perceptions of stakeholders about EFSA in general (as opposed to the credibility of its regulatory outputs), as well as about several other EU agencies. In this paper, we focus on those parts of the study that are consequential for the examination of our hypotheses. The full survey is available in the supplementary Appendix, and replication materials would be available online. 

[^footnote_credibility.pre]: Subject assigned to the independence treatment group, as detailed below, are also told that these agencies “operate independently of the EU political institutions”. We did so in order to further enhance the power of the manipulation. All other pre-manipualtion items are identical for all respondents.   

We next informed participants that we will present them with a recent case of a regulatory risk assessment on food safety policy, and ask for their opinion about it. The case description included three survey pages. The first page, which was identical for all the respondents, included a general background about the regulation of pesticides in the EU. The second page included a short background text about EFSA, and served as the experimental manipulation for its independence from political stakeholders. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. For the treatment group, the text emphasized the independence of EFSA from the political EU institutions and  Member States. The text of the control condition stressed instead EFSA’s advice and communication roles as key functions of EFSA.

Finally, the third page included a summary of a real EFSA scientific opinion about a specific pesticide. Once more, participants were allocated to one of two pesticide cases. The first case pertained to a pesticide named *Flupyradifurone*, which was approved by the  European Commission, based on the EFSA’s risk assessment of the substance [@european2015conclusion]. Respondents were explained that EFSA could not identify a high risk associated with the use of this pesticide, although it did noted completely rule out its risks for human health. The second case regarded another pesticide, *Amitrole*, which roughly at the same time was banned by the European Commission on the basis of EFSA’s risk assessment [@european2014conclusion]. Respondents were informed that EFSA did identify critical concerns associated with the use of the pesticide. We henceforth regard the two cases in short as the “approve pesticide” and the “ban pesticide” cases.

The different versions are presented in `r figure.x=figure.x+1`**Figure `r figure.x`**.

![](C:/SAAR/UNIVERSITY/R/EFSA/papers/myfigures/manipulations.png) 
<br>

After reading the description of EFSA's risk assessment, respondents are asked about the credibility of the opinion, and then they are asked about the degree to which they perceive EFSA, in general, as independent from political stakeholders. We then included additional questions about their perceptions of EFSA in general, which were followed by questions about their familiarity with agency, their influence by its decisions and the frequency of interaction with it. We then asked them a set of demographic questions and questions about their professional background. Lastly, we included a comprehension-check question, to confirm that respondents have read and understood the regulatory risk assessments.

## *Variables*

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=F}
alpha_considerations = psych::alpha(select(
  efsa_00,
  credibility.pest.q1,
  credibility.pest.q2,

))[["total"]][["raw_alpha"]] %>% round(2)

alpha_expertise = psych::alpha(select(efsa_00, credibility.pest.q4,
                                      credibility.pest.q5))[["total"]][["raw_alpha"]] %>% round(2)

library(lavaan)

cfa.model.0 <- ' policy.credibility  =~ credibility.pest.q1 + credibility.pest.q2 + credibility.pest.q3 + credibility.pest.q4 + credibility.pest.q5 + credibility.pest.q6 '

fit0 <- cfa(cfa.model.0,
            std.lv = TRUE,
            missing = "fiml",
            data = efsa_00)

cfa.model.1 <-
  ' non.interference  =~ credibility.pest.q1 + credibility.pest.q2 + credibility.pest.q3
              expert.based =~ credibility.pest.q4 + credibility.pest.q5
              stability   =~ credibility.pest.q6 '

fit1 <- cfa(cfa.model.1, 
           std.lv=TRUE,  
           missing="fiml",  
           data=efsa_00)

anova.1 <- anova(fit1, fit0) %>% tidy()


```

Our outcome variable, the *perceived credibility* of the regulatory output, is measured in the survey using six Likert-scale items, ranging between -5 (strongly disagree) and +5 (strongly agree). These items aim to capture the *three aspects or sub-dimensions of policy credibility*, in accordance with our conceptualization: *stability*, *political non-interference* and *expert-based quality*. To reiterate, the first aspect regards the extent to which the regulatory output is essentially impartial/politics-free i.e. whether it is strictly based on relevant considerations without political interference. This is aspect is measured through three items: "I believe that the opinion was influenced by political interests" (reversed); "I believe that the opinion was affected by the industry interests" (reversed); "I believe that the opinion was based strictly on scientific considerations" (Cronbach’s alpha = `r alpha_considerations`). The second aspect regards the extent to which the decision is based on adequate, professional procedures, and reflect expertise. Is measured through two items: "I believe that the opinion was formed after evaluating all the relevant data and evidence"; "I believe that the assessment of the evidence was based on adequate methods" (Cronbach’s alpha = `r alpha_expertise`). Finally, the third aspect regards the time-consistency of the decision, it is likely to be reversed or altered. The latter is measured through the following single item: "I believe that EFSA's opinion about the pesticide may change the next time it will be asked to reexamine it" (reversed). The six items were presented to respondents in a random order, to rule out a possibility that responses to a question are driven by participants’ attempts to assimilate their responses with other questions asked before.[^footnote_cfa]

[^footnote_cfa]: We conducted confirmatory factor analysis using R `lavaan` package. These analyses suggest that the three-factors model fits the data significantly better than a model with a single latent factor for credibility ($\chi^2$ = `r anova.1 %>% filter(term=="fit0") %>% select(Chisq.diff) %>% max() %>% round(1)`, *p*<.001). Fit indices of the two models, and factor loadings are reported in the supplementary appendix, along with the distributions of all items and their correlations. It should be noted that the item "I believe that the opinion was based strictly on scientific considerations", is more strongly correlated with the two items of the expert-based dimension. Still, for theoretical reasons, we believe that this item should be included in the non-interference dimention, to better capture the concept. In the supplementary appendix, we conduct the analyses while including this item in the in expert-based dimension instead. We also run analyses on this single item. 

Our *first explanatory variable* is the *perceived independence of EFSA* from political stakeholders. This variable is measured through the following item: “EFSA’s opinions can be influenced by EU political institutions (European Commission, Council, Parliament)”. The item was showed to the respondents after the abovementioned credibility questions, and had a similar scale of -5 to +5. For the analysis, we reversed this item, so that high values indicate high perceived independence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore directly external stakeholders' perceptions about the agencies' political independence (as opposed to measures of their actual independence) [##check that##]. This measure is meaningful, given that the regualtion literature assumes that credibility depends on stakeholders' *subjective beliefs* about the ability of political stakeholders to intervene in agencies' policy decisions.  

While examining the correlation between the perceived independence of EFSA and perceived regulatory credibility is important for exploring the independence--credibility thesis, this test alone does not enable us to effectively depict causal relations between the two variables, even when controlling for covariates. This is due to the concern of endogeneity. To address this limitation, we included the abovementioned manipulation of EFSA’s independence, which enabled us to supplement our observational analysis with a rigorous experimental test. We apply an Instrumental Variable (IV) approach [@sovey2011instrumental; for a similar approach in Public Administration research see: @hvidman2019citizens; @grimmelikhuijsen2015effects]. According to this method, we first assess the causal effect of our manipulation on the perceived independence of EFSA and assess variation in perceived independence that can be attributed to this causal effect. Then, in the second stage, we examine wheather the variation induced by the manipualtion can be further associated with variation in stakeholders' perceptions of the credibility of EFSA's regulatory outputs. Altogether, this enables us to test the causal of the perceived independence of EFSA on its perceived credibility. While IV estimation can be also applied in non-experimental designs, using a random assignment significantly enhances the validity of the instrument, by ensuring that it is exogenous, and uncorrelated with the error term of the outcome variable (known as the independence assumption). Below, in the results section, we discuss the validity of all the assumptions of IV analysis.

Our *second explanatory variable* is constituted by *stakeholders’ prior positions* regarding the risk of pesticides. To account for the latter, we asked participants whether the use of pesticides “mainly brings benefits and opportunities, or rather poses a threat”. Participants answered on an 11 points scale ranging between -5 (mainly poses a threat) to +5 (mainly brings benefits). We explore the interaction between this variable and the manipulation of regulatory outcome (i.e. ban vs. approve pesticide).

In addition to the independent variables above, the survey also included additional items regarding respondents’ age, gender, educational background, support for EU political institutions, familiarity and intensity of interactions with EFSA and native language. The experimental groups are fairly balanced with respect to the different types of organizations, as well as to demographics and pre-manipulation variables, as demonstrated in `r table.x=table.x+1`**Table `r table.x`**.[^footnote_balance_exception] Our data also confirms that respondents have read the risk assessments and understood their outcomes. `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(comprehension.check==1) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(comprehension.check) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of the respondents answered correctly the comprehension-check question, in which they were asked whether the pesticide was approved or banned.[^footnote_comprehension_check] 

Summary statistics and correlation matrix for all variables are available in the supplementary appendix.

[^footnote_balance_exception]: One exception is that the independence treatment group has relatively more participants not from NGOs or industry organizations (*p*=`r chisq.test(efsa_00.t1$treatment,efsa_00.t1$organization.type.short)[["p.value"]] %>% round(2)`). To adjust for small finite-sample imbalances, we control for covariates in the regression analyses.[##TBA##]  

[^footnote_comprehension_check]: The comprehension-check scores are fairly similar across the two regulatory decisions, with no statistically significant differences. In robust analyses, reported in the supplementary appendix, we excluded from the analysis the few respondents that did not answer the question correctly, with no major changes to the results [## TBA ##].

# RESULTS
We begin by descriptively exploring the research variables. `r figure.x=figure.x+1`**Figure `r figure.x`** graphically presents the means and distribution of the three credibility components with regard to the two decisions. Overall, participants tend to perceive both opinions as relatively credible, with the exception that the approve-pesticide outcome is not perceived as stable/time-consistent (*Mean* = `r efsa_00_approve.pest%>% summarise(mean(credibility.pest.commitment,na.rm=T))%>%max()%>%round(2)` on a scale of -5 to 5, only `r ((efsa_00_approve.pest %>% filter(credibility.pest.commitment>0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00_approve.pest %>% drop_na(credibility.pest.commitment) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of the answers were above 0`). On average, respondents tend to perceive the ban-pesticide outcome as more credible. The three measures are correlated with each other, and are also positively associated with questions about EFSA’s credibility, in general. It should be noted, however, that the correlation of the latter with the stability aspect is weaker. The three credibility measures are also associated with greater trust in the EU institutions, and perceived familiarity with the agency.

Perceived independence has a right-skewed distribution (*Mean* = `r efsa_00.t1%>%summarise(mean(independence.polit.efsa))%>%max()%>%round(2)`, *SD* = `r efsa_00.t1%>%summarise(sd(independence.polit.efsa))%>%max()%>%round(2)`, *Median* = `r efsa_00.t1%>%summarise(median(independence.polit.efsa))%>%max()%>%round(2)`). This entails that despite the high formal independence of EFSA, the majority of stakeholders in our sample tended to state that political stakeholders can affect EFSA’s opinions.  


Our measure for stakeholders’ prior positions regarding pesticides has a relatively high variation among the entire sample (*Mean* = `r efsa_00%>%summarise(mean(supports.pesticides, na.rm=T))%>%max()%>%round(2)`, *SD* = `r efsa_00%>%summarise(sd(supports.pesticides, na.rm=T))%>%max()%>%round(2)`, *Median* = `r efsa_00%>%summarise(median(supports.pesticides, na.rm=T))%>%max()%>%round(2)`). It has a relatively uniform distribution, with the exception that relatively few stakeholders reported +4 or +5 (i.e. very high support for pesticides).  As anticipated, these prior positions are associated with the distinction between the NGOs and the industry. Stakeholders from NGOs hold relatively negative beliefs towards the use of pesticides (only `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="2-ngo",supports.pesticides>0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="2-ngo") %>%  drop_na(supports.pesticides) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of them were above zero), whereas stakeholders affiliated with the food industry tend to hold a relatively positive view (`r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="1-industry",supports.pesticides<0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="1-industry") %>%  drop_na(supports.pesticides) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of them reported below zero). Stakeholders from other organizations were spread along the two sides of the scale. These differences are statistically significant ($\chi^2$(`r chisq.test(efsa_00$supports.pesticides,efsa_00$organization.type.short)[["parameter"]] %>% max()`) = `r chisq.test(efsa_00$supports.pesticides,efsa_00$organization.type.short)[["statistic"]][["X-squared"]] %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01).

## The effect of perceived independence on perceived credibility

We now turn to exploring observationally the relationship between stakeholders’ perceptions of EFSA’s independence from politicians and their perceptions about the credibility of its regulatory outputs. `r figure.x=figure.x+1`**Figure `r figure.x`** graphically shows the bivariate correlations between perceived independence and the three aspects/sub-dimensions of credibility. Indeed, perceived independence is positively associated with all three aspects of credibility. The correlation with the perceived impartiality dimension is fairly strong (*r* = `r cor.test(efsa_00.t1$credibility.pest.considerations,efsa_00.t1$independence.polit.efsa)[["estimate"]][["cor"]] %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01), whereas  the correlations with its perceived expertise-based quality and stability are moderate (*r* = `r cor.test(efsa_00.t1$credibility.pest.expertise,efsa_00.t1$independence.polit.efsa)[["estimate"]][["cor"]] %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01 and *r* = `r cor.test(efsa_00.t1$credibility.pest.commitment,efsa_00.t1$independence.polit.efsa)[["estimate"]][["cor"]] %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01, respectively). This stands in contrast with  regulation literature’s strong emphasis on the relations between independence and time-consistency.

                                 1,
                               data = efsa_00.t1)


tmod.considerations.1 <- update(tmod.considerations.null, . ~ . +
                                  independence.polit.efsa)

tmod.commitment.1 <- update(tmod.considerations.1, credibility.pest.commitment ~ . )
tmod.commitment.2 <- update(tmod.considerations.2, credibility.pest.commitment ~ . )

```


Next, we run multivariate regression analyses, to examine the effect of participants’ prior positions on pesticides (in interaction with the regulatory outcome manipulation), over and above the effect of perceived independence. `r table.x=table.x+1`**Table `r table.x`** shows the results of the regression analyses. For each of the three aspects, we include 4 regression models. First, we regress the outcome variable on perceived independence (Models 1,5,9). Thereafter, we add the outcome manipulation (0 = approve pesticide; 1 = ban pesticide) (Models 2,6,10), and participants’ prior positions support for pesticides (Models 3,7,11). Finally, we add the interaction between the outcome manipulation and support for pesticides.  

The effect of perceived independence remains positive and significant. Controlling for the other covariates, a one standard deviation increase in perceived independence is associated with an increase of `r tmod.considerations.2 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="independence.polit.efsa") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` standard deviations in the *political non-interference (impartiality) dimension*, and an increase of `r tmod.expertise.2 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="independence.polit.efsa") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` - `r tmod.commitment.2 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="independence.polit.efsa") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` standard deviations in the *expertise-based* and the *time-consistency* dimensions.[^footnote_regression.interaction.independence]

For all three aspects, the interactions between the prior belief support for pesticides  and the outcome manipulation are negative and significant. These interactions indicate that *over and above the effect of stakeholders’ perceptions about the independence of the agency, participants are significantly more likely to perceive a regulatory outcome as credible inasmuch as it corresponds to their prior positions* on the matter. The more a stakeholder regards pesticides in general as safe, the more she is likely to perceive EFSA’s opinion to approve a pesticide as more credible then an opinion to ban it. The simple effect of support for pesticide is positive and significant for all three aspects. This indicates that *the more (less) a stakeholder perceives pesticides as safe, the more (less) she is likely to perceive an approve as credible*. Yet, the marginal effect of support for pesticides in the ban outcome is null. Altogether, this means that stakeholders supporting pesticides are more likely to accept the credibility of a ban outcome than stakeholders opposing pesticides are likely to accept the credibility of an approve outcome. In additional analyses, reported in the supplementary appendix, we further added the interaction between the outcome manipulation and the different groups of stakeholders. These analyses also show that stakeholders from NGOs, which are mostly critical about the safety of pesticides, tend to perceive an opinion to ban a pesticide as more credible—in the sense of more impartial and more expert-based—than an opinion to approve the pesticide.

[^footnote_regression.interaction.independence]: In other models, not shown here, we also confirmed that there is no interaction between perceived independence and the decision manipulation.

We now turn to our experimental examination of the effect of perceived independence. To reiterate, we manipulated the perceived independence of EFSA by randomly assigning participants to treatment and control conditions. The treatment group read an introduction about EFSA, emphasizing the agency’s independence from political stakeholders, whereas the control group read another text, emphasizing EFSA’s communication and advice roles (see also Figure 1).

We regard this random assignment as an *instrumental variable* - we estimate the extent to which the credibility of the decisions are influenced by the change in the perceived independence that is caused by the manipulation [@hvidman2019citizens]. Applying an instrumental variable analysis requires three assumptions: First, the instrumental variable (i.e. the independence treatment) is associated to the endogenous explanatory variable (i.e. perceived independence of EFSA). Indeed, our independence manipulation has a positive and significant effect on the perceived independence of EFSA (*Diff* = `r (mean(efsa_00_treatment$independence.polit.efsa,na.rm = T)-mean(efsa_00_control$independence.polit.efsa,na.rm = T)) %>% round(2)` [`r t.test(independence.polit.efsa~treatment,efsa_00)[["conf.int"]][1] %>% round(2)`,`r t.test(independence.polit.efsa~treatment,efsa_00)[["conf.int"]][2] %>% round(2)`], *t* = `r max(t.test(independence.polit.efsa~treatment,efsa_00)[["statistic"]]) %>% abs() %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01).[^footnote_iv.first.stage] Second, the instrument is exogenous, and uncorrelated with the error term of the outcome variable in the model. That assumption is ensured by the random assignment. Third, the instrument is assumed, theoretically, to affect the outcome variable only through its effect on the treatment. Since the treatment condition emphasized the independence of EFSA from political stakeholders, we are capable of making that assumption.               

[^footnote_iv.first.stage]: It should be noted that this correlation is slightly weaker than the recommended standard (*F*>10, or *t*>3.16). This entails that the instrumental variable estimate is likely to be less accurate. Still... [TBA] 


`r table.x=table.x+1`**Table `r table.x`** compares the perceived independence and the three credibility aspects between the control and treatment conditions. The first row shows the differences in perceived personal relevance (*the first stage*). Thereafter, for each of the three credibility aspects, we show the raw differences between the two groups (*the reduced form*) and then the instrumental variable (IV) estimate. The reduced form can be interpreted as the causal effect of priming stakeholders about the independence of EFSA. The IV estimate, which equals to the difference in credibility divided by the difference in perceived independence, represents the effect of perceived independence attributed to the manipulation. The findings reveal that the *participants assigned to the independence treatment condition reported, on average, higher values for all three dimensions of credibility (reduced form), yet these differences are significant only in relation to the political non-interference dimension* (*p* = `r (t.test(credibility.pest.considerations~treatment,efsa_00 %>% drop_na(independence.polit.efsa))[["p.value"]]/2) %>% round(3)`, one-tailed test).

We further run OLS and 2SLS instrumental variable regression analysis for the three dimensions. These analyses provide a more accurate estimate, by controlling for covariates and estimating the statistical uncertainty. `r table.x=table.x+1`**Table `r table.x`** shows the results of these models. All models control for same covariates in the models presented above. Again, through IV analysis, *we identify with sufficient confidence only the causal effect of perceived independence on the perceived impartiality dimension of credibility*. The 2SLS model (Model 5) predicts that a one standard deviation increase in perceived independence *causes* an increase of xx standard deviations in the impartiality dimension.

`r figure.x=figure.x+1`**Figure `r figure.x`** graphically illustrates the interaction between the outcome manipulation and support for pesticides. It presents the marginal effect of a ban pesticide outcome, conditional on respondents’ self-reported prior support for pesticides (controlling for perceived independence). It also displays the marginal effect of the manipulation within each of the quintiles of the moderator [@hainmueller2019much] (Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu 2018). These analyses suggest that those who have very negative prior positions would perceive a ban opinion as more credible, yet the differences are attenuated and even reversed the more they perceive pesticides favorably. As for the stability dimension, the ban is perceived as much more stable to begin with, and thus the conditional effect for those with positive positions is null, and not negative. This can be explained by the fact that bans are by default more stable (less reversible) compared to approvals as approved substances regularly come up for license renewal (and reassessment), which can result in either an approval or a ban.

In relation to the approve outcome, Controlling for the other covariates, a one standard deviation increase in support for pesticides, is associated with `r tmod.commitment.2 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="supports.pesticides") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` standard deviations in the time-consistency dimension (compared to `r tmod.commitment.2 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="independence.polit.efsa") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` of perceived independence), `r tmod.considerations.2 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="supports.pesticides") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` standard deviations in the  non-interference dimension dimension (compared with `r tmod.considerations.2 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="independence.polit.efsa") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)`), and  `r tmod.expertise.2 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="supports.pesticides") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` standard deviations in the expertise-based dimension (compared with only `r tmod.expertise.2 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="independence.polit.efsa") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)`). Hence, when EFSA finds a low risk associated with the use of a pesticide, prior beliefs plays an important role in shaping the perceived credibility of this outcome. In particular, in relation to the expertise-based quality dimension, it much more influential than the perceived credibility of the agency.

In sum, our observational analyses suggest that perceptions of independence are associated with greater credibility. While the effect is fairly strong with respect to the non-interference dimension of credibility, for the other two dimensions of credibility, the effect is significant, yet quite moderate. At the same time, stakeholders’ pre-determined perceptions play an important, *and perhaps even greater role in shaping regulatory credibility*, and mainly in terms of the perceived impartiality and expertise-based quality of regulatory outputs.

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Despite the prominence of the independence-credibility thesis in the regulation literature, and the widespread worldwide prevalence of regulatory bodies shaped in accordance to its tenants—independent agencies, the assumption remained untested. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to directly examine the relationship between the two variables. We provide a robust empirical test for their causal relation by combining both observational and experimental analyses. We focus on a crucial case – EFSA, and explore the perceptions of real external audiences in relation to real opinions of the agency. Altogether, we believe that this is a fairly rigorous empirical test.

We find support for the assumption that greater independence increases stakeholders’ perceptions about the impartial nature (or political non-interference) of regulatory outputs, which we regard as a key dimension of regulatory credibility. This finding is supported by both observational and experimental analyses. However, for the effect of independence on the other two key dimensions of credibility—the perceived professional quality and time-consistency— we find, at best, a weak support. We did find observational correlation between them, but this is relatively small and there is no evidence for a causal effect by our independence manipulation.

At the same time, our study provides strong support for our second hypothesis that stakeholders’ perception of regulatory credibility is greatly influenced by their prior positions. Those who tend to support pesticides in the first place would find a decision to approve a pesticide more credible than a decision to ban one, and vice-versa. Moreover, our findings suggest that *these prior positions have a much greater effect on credibility compared with their perceptions of agency independence*. We attribute this to a motivated reasoning mechanism. 

Still, our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First of all, our findings are based on only one agency. Future research would put this theory to further rigorous test by exploring the relationship in the context of other agencies, and by comparing different types of agencies. It could well be the case that the stability (time consistency) dimension is more central to economic regulators, and it cannot be ruled out, on the basis of the current study, that the effect of perceived independence on this dimension could potentially be present for such agencies. Second, we acknowledge the limited statistical power of our study, given our sample size. Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that our independence treatment has an effect on stability and expert-based quality of the regulatory output, that could have been identified in a bigger sample. Still, even if such a causal effect exists, the effect size is likely to be relatively weak indeed. 

Overall, our findings, while lending partial support to the independence-credibility assumption, simultaneously reveal the limitation of this rationalistic assumptions. A main implication of our study  is that controversial regulatory areas are not automatically depoliticised by fiat. In such areas, independent agencies are likely to face ongoing criticism about their outputs, despite the institutional insulation measures undertaken to secure depoliticized, expert-based, scientific decision-making. This could make them an easy target for political actors and stakeholders that ideologically-oppose regulatory outcomes. Agencies and their staff, unlike politicians, are often ill-equipped to handle these kind of attacks: The main tool in their arsenal—‘independent expertise’—is insufficient to address and qualm what are essentially political rather than technical objections to specific regulatory outcomes. This amounts to a major obstacle to non-majoritarian regulators’ ability to achieve their much-heralded organisational *raison d’etre* –injecting credibility in to the regulatory system. 

How can this be mitigated? First, it is clear that it cannot be solely mitigated by granting agencies institutional independence. While important for credibility, in and of itself institutional independence is not the wholesale panacea widely heralded to be in terms of regulatory credibility. Part of the solution is necessarily dispelling the institutional myth of ‘depoliticization by design’ by acknowledging its limitations and the partial ‘fix’ it provides. The unchallenged faith in the rationalistic assumption of depoliticization by fiat as a ‘fix-it-all’ can cause great disservice to non-majoritarian regulatory bodies as it effectively neglects and denies the ongoing relevance of political rationale shaping stakeholder perceptions of regulatory outputs and eroding at their credibility. Inadvertently, by neglecting this dimension, we fail to acknowledge  the source of such challenges for what they are: ideological/political objections, and risk compounding what are essentially political (contingent) considerations with technical objections. We risk assuming that when sustained attacks do occur, they are an indication of agencies’ potential bias or regulatory failure as opposed to a systemic failure to secure depoliticization through insulation. In their search for credibility, independent regulatory agencies navigate heavily controversial and politicized waters as opposed to inhabiting mythically-depoliticized bubbles where the power of expertise reigns supreme.
