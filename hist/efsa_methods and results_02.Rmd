# METHODOLOGY
We empirically examine these hypotheses in relation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). We conducted an experiment, embedded in a survey among external stakeholders of EFSA, as detailed below. The employment of an experimental design enables us to rigorously examine the causal effects of perceived independence and prior standpoints on regulatory credibility. At the same time, by surveying real stakeholders about actual regulatory outputs of the agency, we substantiate the study’s generalizability to real-world settings.

While experiments have been widely used by public administration scholars in recent years to explore the perceptions of citizens and political representatives about public sector agencies (Baekgaard et al. 2015; Grimmelikhuijsen et al. 2016; Jilke, Van de Walle, and Kim 2016; for a systematic review of experimental studies in public administration see: Li and Van Ryzin 2017), to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to experimentally examine the factors that shape the perceptions of a broad array of stakeholders regarding agencies’ scientific regulatory outputs. In addition, this is the first study to manipulate agencies perceived independence from political stakeholders.

In the following section we provide background on the empirical case. Thereafter, we describe the population of survey respondents and their selection and recruitment, the course of the survey and experimental procedures and the operationalization of our main variables.

<br>

## *European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and pesticides regulation*
We put the assumption to test in a crucial case—the case of the European Food Safety Agency. EFSA is an independent, non-majoritarian agency, operating at the EU level, a separate institutional body from the EU institutions and the member states, with its own staff and budget. The agency is the product of a credibility crisis, part of the reform process of European food safety regulation, in response to a set of damaging food scandals in the late 1990s, linked to the politicization of regulatory policy. The agency’s creation in 2002 formally signaled the separation of scientific risk assessment, carried out by EFSA, from risk management, carried out by the European Commission. The separation of science from politics was seen as critical in order to rebuilt public confidence in the European regulatory food policy after the BSE and dioxin crises in particular (Vos 2000; Groenleer 2009; Busuioc 2013). 

In light of the circumstances surrounding its creation, EFSA’s set up is strongly predicated on its independence from politics and this logic is heavily reflected in the agency’s structures: “There are few EU organisations that can claim as much formal autonomy as EFSA” (Groenleer 2009, 181). In contrast to other EU agencies, where management boards are overwhelmingly made up of national representatives (one representative for each member state), EFSA’s 15-member governing board is exceptionally appointed *in a personal capacity*. Moreover, to further ensure separation from political considerations, EFSA’s scientific committee and panel members are independent scientists that are not nominated by national authorities of the member states. Again, this is in contrast to other European agencies— (e.g. the European Medicines Agency) where scientific committees contain members nominated by member states and the agency financially compensates national authorities for scientific work carried out for the EU agency (Groenleer 2009).

EFSA’s mandate pertains to both risk assessment and risk communication and covers the areas of food and feed safety, nutrition, animal health and welfare, plant protection and plant health. In its risk assessor role, EFSA produces scientific opinions, which are adopted into biding decisions by the risk manager, the European Commission. The agency’s broad mandate covers areas that are heavily politicised in the European context such as the regulation of GMOs, pesticides or food additives. 

In light of the above, this renders it an especially relevant case to study the link between independence and credibility in contested environments. EFSA is a crucial case (Eckstein 1975; see also Gerring and Cojocaru 2016), one that “must closely fit a theory if one is to have confidence in the theory’s validity” (Eckstein 1975), for the independence–credibility assumption. The pesticides case is especially relevant to study the impact of independence on perceptions of credibility. Pesticide regulation is a highly salient area, subject to much controversy with strong stances on (different sides of) the matter from the pesticide industry, green groups, farmers, organic industry and EU citizens at large. For instance in 2017, over 1,300,000 European citizens signed a petition to ban glyphosate, the world’s most widely-used herbicide, at the time up for regulatory assessment for the approval of its licence renewal. Following the controversy over glyphosate’s approval, EFSA’s executive director, Bernard Url, has publicly expressed his concern that advocacy organizations tend to judge EFSA’s scientific opinions selectively, depending on their bottom line: “Agencies that find low risk of regulated products are often accused of undue industry influence. We at EFSA believe that some campaigners are unwilling to accept any evidence that certain regulated substances are safe, and will tout weak scientific studies showing the opposite. The same groups applauded EFSA for reviews on other pesticides, such as neonicotinoids, that it deemed dangerous. It seems to us that some campaigners contest the science of safety assessments in pursuit of greater political arguments… So, when campaigners allege that EFSA did not follow due scientific process when assessing glyphosate, we believe that they are really railing against bigger issues: the role of modern agricultural practices and multinational biotech firms in our food supply.” (Url 2018, p. 381).   

At the same time, EFSA has been also criticized by farmers and food industry organizations in several cases where the agency’s scientific committees identified a high risk for the use of pesticides, as well as food additives and Genetically Modified foods (GMO). Overall, Moreover, over the past years, EFSA has been criticized for its scientific opinions from both sides (e.g. Groenleer 2009; Rimkute 2018).

## *Data collection*

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=F}
n.invitations = 654
n.errors = 46
n.invitations_effective = n.invitations-n.errors

n.start = efsa_00 %>% nrow()
n.reach_credibility.pest = efsa_00 %>% drop_na(credibility.pest.index) %>% nrow()
n.reach_independence = efsa_00 %>% drop_na(independence.polit.efsa) %>% nrow()
n.reach_end = efsa_raw %>% filter(Q13.13 !=0)%>% nrow()

```

We constructed a list of names, organizational affiliation and contact details of potential stakeholders of EFSA, based on a number of sources. First, to identify the relevant stakeholders, we relied on the *EU Transparency Register* (http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister), which includes information on more than 10,000 organisations representing particular interests at EU level (Joint Transparency Register Secretariat, 2019). The register’s information is updated annually by the organizations themselves, and includes contact details of their “person with legal responsibility” and “person in charge of EU relations”. To restrict the list to potential stakeholders of EFSA, we filtered the dataset based on organizations’ self-reporting of their goals, activities and fields on interest. This search yielded a list of 3,155 persons from 2,045 different organizations related to the domains of ‘food and agriculture’, including representatives of the industry, NGOs and advocacy groups, professional organizations engaging in research, law firms and consultancy groups. We then supplemented this list, with EFSA’s list of “registered stakeholders” and lists of stakeholders  that attended over the years EFSA meetings with stakeholders, both obtained from EFSA’s website. The latter sources, which were obtained from EFSA’s website, included 392 persons from 259 organizations. Further details about the construction the two lists are available in the supplementary appendix [TBA].

Thereafter, we searched the internet for email addresses of these stakeholders. For the stakeholders retrieved from the transparency register, we conducted an automatic search. We avoided time-consuming manual search, and instead we web-scraped organizations’ official websites, and matched the found email patterns with participants’ names and initials.[^footnote_email.scraping] Through this method, we retrieved email addresses of 425 stakeholders (`r ((425/3155)*100) %>% round(0)`% of total names in the list). As for the second list of participants in EFSA meetings and consultations, we conducted both automatic and manual online searches, through which we managed to retrieve emails of 229 stakeholders (`r ((229/392)*100) %>% round(0)`%). 

[^footnote_email.scraping]: Our r code is available at: https://github.com/saaralonbarkat/stakeholders.emails. 

The survey was conducted online through Qualtrics Survey Software. Between February-May 2019, we sent a total of `r n.invitations` email invitations with anonymous links to the survey, followed by three reminders. We contacted stakeholders from a university email address, and invited the stakeholders to fill in the anonymous survey. We also asked them to invite other executives and staff members in their organizations to fill out the survey. Importantly, to avoid priming them about food policy and mitigate potential selection bias, we did not directly inform them about the study’s focus on EFSA and food regulation. Rather, we generally presented it as an expert survey on regulatory policy at the EU, while noting that participants are asked about a specific regulatory policy area, in their case - food safety. 

In total, `r n.start` people started filling the survey, and `r n.reach_independence` completed the main part of the survey, which represent a sizable response rate of roughly `r (n.reach_independence/n.invitations_effective*100)%>% round(-1)`%.[^footnote_response.rate] More than half of the respondents (`r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(age>=50) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(age) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`%) are older than 50 years, `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(female==0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(female) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% are men and `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(education %in% c("3 Master","4 Doctorat")) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(education) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% have a Master or Doctorate degree. `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="1-industry") %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(organization.type.short) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of respondents reported working in a company or a trade association, `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="2-ngo") %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(organization.type.short) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% in an NGO, and the remaining `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="0-other") %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(organization.type.short) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% elsewhere (henceforth referred as "others"). To assess the relevance of EFSA to these respondents, we asked them towards the end of the survey a series of questions regarding their knowledge of and interaction with  the agency. Overall, `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(informed.efsa>0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(informed.efsa) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of respondents indicated that they are well informed about the agency's mandate (more than 0 on a -5 to +5 Likert scale), `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(affect.decisions.efsa>0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(affect.decisions.efsa) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% reported that the agency’s decisions may affect the operations of their organization and `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(str_detect(interact.efsa,c("2.|3.|4.|5."))==T) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(interact.efsa) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% reported that their organization interacts with EFSA at least once a year. In addition, at the begining of the survey, `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.area.food==1) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(organization.area.food) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of respondents identified the policy domain of "food and agriculture" as most relevant to the operations of their organization. Overall, we believe that our respondents represent a relatively diverse sample of external stakeholders of EFSA. The demographic and organizational characteristics of our sample of respondents are summarized in the supplementary appendix [## TBA ##]. 

[## TBA power analysis - We cannot rely on previous studies to assess the effect size of our treatment. This sample size has sufficient power (0.8) to identify an effect of Cohen's D = 0.5. ##]

[## TBA - analysis of selection bias, based on comparison between percentage of industry and NGOs in our lists and in the final sample ##].      

[^footnote_response.rate]: To estimate response rate, we divided the number of observations by the number of invitations while subtracting the email addresses that returned automatic error messages (*n*=45). However, since some of the respondents received the invitation from other participants rather than directly by us, the exact response rate may be somewhat lower.   

<br>

## *Procedure*
Consistent with the email invitation, the questionnaire was introduced to the participants as an expert survey related to an academic study on regulatory policy at the EU level. After obtaining respondents’ consent, we first asked them to specify the type of organization for which they work, as well as the policy areas that are most relevant to the operations of their organization. Thereafter, we asked them about their trust in EU political institutions (European Commission, Parliament, Council). We then mentioned four EU agencies (being EFSA one of them), and asked to what extent they perceive them as credible regulators.[^footnote_credibility.pre] Next, we asked them a set of questions aimed at assessing their prior positions about food safety regulation, and pesticides in particular. To disguise our focus on food policy, we framed this section as questions about new technologies, and the opportunities these bring versus the threats they pose. We included in this section questions about technologies related to food, as well as to other policy domains. To further avoid priming, we then asked the respondents three additional questions regarding the use of machine learning algorithms in decision-making, in line with the abovementioned frame. 

[^footnote_credibility.pre]: Subject assigned to the independence treatment group, as detailed below, are also told that these agencies “operate independently of the EU political institutions”. We did so in order to further enhance the power of the manipulation. All other items are identical for all respondents.   

We next informed participants that we will present them with a recent case of a regulatory risk assessment on food safety policy, and ask for their opinion about it. The case description included three survey pages. The first page, which was identical for all the respondents, included a general background about the regulation of pesticides in the EU. The second page included a short background text about EFSA, and served as the experimental manipulation for its independence from political stakeholders. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. For the treatment group, the text emphasized the independence of EFSA from the political EU institutions and  Member States. The text of the control condition stressed instead EFSA’s advice and communication roles as key functions of EFSA.

Finally, the third page included a summary of a real EFSA scientific opinion about a specific pesticide. Once more, participants were allocated to one of two pesticide cases. The first case pertained to a pesticide named *Flupyradifurone*, which was approved by the  European Commission, based on the EFSA’s risk assessment of the substance (European Food Safety Authority 2015). Respondents were explained that EFSA could not identify a high risk associated with the use of this pesticide, although it did noted completely rule out its risks for human health. The second case regarded another pesticide, *Amitrole*, which roughly at the same time was banned by the European Commission on the basis of EFSA’s risk assessment (European Food Safety Authority 2014). Respondents were informed that EFSA did identify critical concerns associated with the use of the pesticide. We henceforth regard the two cases in short as the “approve pesticide” and the “ban pesticide” cases.

Altogether, the experiment has a factorial design of 2 (Independence: treatment vs. control) x 2 (Decision: approve pesticide vs. ban pesticide). 
The different versions are presented in `r figure.x=figure.x+1`**Figure `r figure.x`**. The four experimental groups are fairly balanced with respect to the different types of organizations, as well as to demographics, and pre-manipulation variables. [## TBA balance table in the appendix ##] We also confirmed that respondents have read the regulatory risk assessments and understood their outcomes. At the end of the survey, we asked respondents whether the ban was approved or banned, and `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(comprehension.check==1) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% drop_na(comprehension.check) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of the respondents answered it correctly (without significant differences between the two decisions). In robust analyses, Wreported in the supplementary appendix, we further excluded from the analysis the respondents that did not answer this question correctly, with no major changes to the results [## TBA ##].

<br>

After reading the description of EFSA's risk assessment, respondents are asked about the credibility of the opinion, as well as about the independence of EFSA in general. After a set of additional general questions about EFSA, the subjects are then asked about their familiarity with the four agencies mentioned at the beginning of the survey, and the frequency of interactions with them. Towards the end of the survey, we asked them a set of demographic questions and questions about their professional background. Finally, we asked a comprehension-check question about the case.  


<br>

## *Variables*

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=F}
alpha_considerations = psych::alpha(select(efsa_00, credibility.pest.q1,credibility.pest.q2,
credibility.pest.q3))[["total"]][["raw_alpha"]]%>%round(2)

alpha_expertise = psych::alpha(select(efsa_00, credibility.pest.q4,
credibility.pest.q5))[["total"]][["raw_alpha"]]%>%round(2)

```

Our outcome variable, the *perceived credibility* of the regulatory output, is measured in the survey using six Likert-scale items, ranging between -5 (strongly disagree) and +5 (strongly agree). These items aim to capture the *three aspects or sub-dimensions of policy credibility*, in accordance with our conceptualization: political non-interference, expert-based quality and policy stability. To reiterate, the first aspect regards the extent to which the decision is strictly based on relevant considerations. This is aspect is measured through three items: "I believe that the opinion was influenced by political interests" (reversed); "I believe that the opinion was affected by the industry interests" (reversed); "I believe that the opinion was based strictly on scientific considerations" (Cronbach’s alpha = `r alpha_considerations`). The second aspect regards the extent to which the decision is based on adequate, professional procedures, and reflect expertise. Is measured through two items: "I believe that the opinion was formed after evaluating all the relevant data and evidence"; "I believe that the assessment of the evidence was based on adequate methods" (Cronbach’s alpha = `r alpha_expertise`). Finally, the third aspect regards the time-consistency of the decision, it is likely to be reversed or altered. The latter is measured through the following single item: "I believe that EFSA's opinion about the pesticide may change the next time it will be asked to reexamine it" (reversed). The six items were presented to respondents in a random order, to rule out a possibility that responses to a question are driven by participants’ attempts to assimilate their responses with other questions asked before. [## TBA assessing fitness of the three components via CFA ##]. 

<br>

Our first explanatory variable is the perceived independence of EFSA from political stakeholders. This variable is measured through the following item: "EFSA’s opinions can be influenced by EU political institutions (European Commission, Council, Parliament)". The item was showed after the abovementioned credibility questions, and had a similar scale of -5 to +5. For the analyses, we reversed this item, so that high values indicate high perceived independence  (*Mean* = `r efsa_00.t1%>%summarise(mean(independence.polit.efsa))%>%max()%>%round(2)`, *SD* = `r efsa_00.t1%>%summarise(sd(independence.polit.efsa))%>%max()%>%round(2)`, *Median* = `r efsa_00.t1%>%summarise(median(independence.polit.efsa))%>%max()%>%round(2)`). However, estimating the correlation between the perceived independence of EFSA and its credibility does not enable to effectively depict causal relations between the two variables, even when controlling for covariates. This is due to the concern of endogeneity. We addressed this limitation in this study by including the abovementioned manipulation for EFSA's independence, which enabled us to supplement our observational analysis with a rigorous experimental test. 

We regard the random assignment to control and treatment independence conditions as an *instrumental variable* - we estimate the extent to which the credibility of the decisions are influenced by the change in the perceived independence that is caused by the manipulation (Hvidman, 2019). Applying an instrumental variable analysis requires three assumptions: First, the instrumental variable (i.e. the independence treatment) is associated to the endogenous explanatory variable (i.e. perceived independence of EFSA). Indeed, our independence manipulation has a positive and significant effect on the perceived independence of EFSA (*Diff* = `r (mean(efsa_00_treatment$independence.polit.efsa,na.rm = T)-mean(efsa_00_control$independence.polit.efsa,na.rm = T)) %>% round(2)` [`r t.test(independence.polit.efsa~treatment,efsa_00)[["conf.int"]][1] %>% round(2)`,`r t.test(independence.polit.efsa~treatment,efsa_00)[["conf.int"]][2] %>% round(2)`], *t* = `r max(t.test(independence.polit.efsa~treatment,efsa_00)[["statistic"]]) %>% abs() %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01).[^footnote_iv.first.stage] Second, the instrument is exogenous, and uncorrelated with the error term of the outcome variable in the model. That assumption is ensured by the random assignment. Third, the instrument is assumed, theoretically, to affect the outcome variable only through its effect on the treatment. Since the treatment condition emphasized the independence of EFSA from political stakeholders, we are capable of making that assumption.               

[^footnote_iv.first.stage]: It should be noted that this correlation is slightly weaker than the recommended standard (*F*>10, or *t*>3.16). This entails that the instrumental variable estimate is likely to be less accurate. Still... [TBA] 

Our second explanatory variable is stakeholders' pre-determined positions regarding the risk of pesticides. To account for the latter, we asked participants whether the use of pesticides "mainly brings benefits and opportunities, or rather poses a threat". Participants answered on an 11 points scale ranging between -5 (mainly poses a threat) to +5 (mainly brings benefits). This variable has a relatively high variation among the entire sample (*Mean* = `r efsa_00%>%summarise(mean(supports.pesticides, na.rm=T))%>%max()%>%round(2)`, *SD* = `r efsa_00%>%summarise(sd(supports.pesticides, na.rm=T))%>%max()%>%round(2)`, *Median* = `r efsa_00%>%summarise(median(supports.pesticides, na.rm=T))%>%max()%>%round(2)`). It is positively correlated with perceived independence of EFSA (*r* = `r cor.test(efsa_00$supports.pesticides,efsa_00$independence.polit.efsa)[["estimate"]][["cor"]] %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01). As anticipated, these prior positions are associated with the distinction between the NGOs and the industry. `r figure.x=figure.x+1`**Figure `r figure.x`** shows the distribution of the variable across the three groups of stakeholders. As shown by the plot, stakeholders from NGOs hold relatively negative beliefs towards the use of pesticides (only `r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="2-ngo",supports.pesticides>0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="2-ngo") %>%  drop_na(supports.pesticides) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of them were above zero), whereas stakeholders affiliated with the food industry tend to hold a relatively positive view (`r ((efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="1-industry",supports.pesticides<0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00 %>% filter(organization.type.short=="1-industry") %>%  drop_na(supports.pesticides) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of them reported below zero). Stakeholders from other organizations were spread along the two sides of the scale. These differences are statistically significant ($\chi^2$(`r chisq.test(efsa_00$supports.pesticides,efsa_00$organization.type.short)[["parameter"]] %>% max()`) = `r chisq.test(efsa_00$supports.pesticides,efsa_00$organization.type.short)[["statistic"]][["X-squared"]] %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01). In our analyses below, we use both the support pesticide item and the organization groups as indicators or proxies for participants' prior positions about regulation of risk of pesticides. We expect an interaction between these variables and the decision manipulation (i.e. ban vs. approve pesticide).

# Results

`r figure.x=figure.x+1`**Figure `r figure.x`** graphically presents the means and distribution of the three credibility components with regard to the two decisions. Overall, participants tend to perceive both decisions as relatively credible, with the exception that the approve-pesticide decision is not perceived as a credible commitment (*Mean* = `r efsa_00_approve.pest%>% summarise(mean(credibility.pest.commitment,na.rm=T))%>%max()%>%round(2)` on a scale of -5 to 5, only `r ((efsa_00_approve.pest %>% filter(credibility.pest.commitment>0) %>% nrow())/(efsa_00_approve.pest %>% drop_na(credibility.pest.commitment) %>% nrow())*100) %>% round(0)`% of the answers were above 0`). Respondents tend to perceive the ban-pesticide decision as more credible, on average. The three measures are correlated with each other, and are also positively associated with the general items on EFSA's credibility and reputation. It should be noted, however, that the correlation of the latter with the commitment item is weaker. The three credibility measures are also associated with greater trust in the EU institutions, and perceived familiarity with the agency.

We begin with exploring the observational relations between stakeholders perceptions about the independence of EFSA from politicians and their perceptions about its credibility. `r figure.x=figure.x+1`**Figure `r figure.x`** graphically shows the bivariate correlations between perceived independence and the three aspects of decision credibility. Indeed, perceived independence is positively associated with all three aspects of credibility, in line with regulation theory. The correlation with the first aspect, i.e. that the decision is not driven by irrelevant considerations, is fairly strong (*r* = `r cor.test(efsa_00.t1$credibility.pest.considerations,efsa_00.t1$independence.polit.efsa)[["estimate"]][["cor"]] %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01). By comparison, the correlations with the perceived expertise and professionalism and the decision's time-consistency are moderate (*r* = `r cor.test(efsa_00.t1$credibility.pest.expertise,efsa_00.t1$independence.polit.efsa)[["estimate"]][["cor"]] %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01 and *r* = `r cor.test(efsa_00.t1$credibility.pest.commitment,efsa_00.t1$independence.polit.efsa)[["estimate"]][["cor"]] %>% round(2)`, *p*<.01, respectively).

Next, we run multivariate regression analyses, to examine the effect participants' prior positions on pesticides (in interaction with the decision manipulation), over and above the effect of perceived independence. `r table.x=table.x+1`**Table `r table.x`** shows the results of the regression analyses. For each of the three aspects, we include 4 regression models. First, we regress the outcome variable on perceived independence (Models 1,5,9). Thereafter, we add the decision manipulation (0 = approve pesticide; 1 = ban pesticide) (Models 2,6,10), and the indicators for participants' prior positions - their support for pesticide and the stakeholders groups (the reference category for the groups is "other") (Models 3,7,11). Finally, we add the interaction between the decision manipulation and the prior positions indicators (Models 4,8,12). For the commitment aspect, the coefficients of the stakeholders groups and their interaction with the decision were not significant, and therefore we excluded them from the model.  

The effect of perceived independence remains positive and significant. Controlling for the other covariates, a one standard deviation increase in perceived independence is associated with an increase of `r tmod1.0.3 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="independence.polit.efsa") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` standard deviations in considerations dimension, and an increase of `r tmod2.0.3 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="independence.polit.efsa") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` - `r tmod3.0.3 %>% sjstats::std_beta() %>% filter(term=="independence.polit.efsa") %>% .[,"std.estimate"] %>% round(2)` standard deviations in the expertise and commitment dimensions.[^footnote_regression.interaction.independence] 

For all three aspects, the interactions between support for pesticide and ban pesticide are negative and significant. These findings indicate that over and above the effect of stakeholders' perceptions about the independence of the agency, participants are significantly more likely to perceive the decision as credible inasmuch as it corresponds to their prior positions. The more a stakeholder perceives pesticides as a safe method, the more she is likely to perceive EFSA's decision to approve a pesticide as more credible then its decision to ban it. Similarly, the interaction between NGOs and the ban pesticide decision is positive and significant with regard to considerations and expertise, but not commitment. stakeholders from NGOs, which are mostly critical about the safety of pesticides, tend to perceive a decision to ban a pesticide as less improperly motivated and more professional then a decision to approve it. 

[^footnote_regression.interaction.independence]: In other models, not shown here, we also confirmed that there is no interaction between perceived independence and the decision manipulation.

`r figure.x=figure.x+1`**Figure `r figure.x`** graphically illustrates the interaction between decision manipulation and support for pesticides. It presents the marginal effect of ban pesticide decision, conditional on respondents’ self-reported prior support for pesticides (the model controls for perceived independence but not for stakeholders' groups). It also displays the marginal effect of the manipulation within each of the quintiles of the moderator (Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu 2018). These analyses suggest that those who have very negative prior positions would perceive a decision to ban a pesticide as more credible, yet the differences are attenuated and even reversed the more they perceive pesticides favorably. As for the commitment dimension, the ban decision is perceived as much more stable to begin with, and thus the conditional effect for those with positive positions is null, and not negative.

A comparison of the fit of the regression models also provide a tentative indication about the relative size of the effects of independence versus participants' prior beliefs. For the dimension of considerations, perceived independence alone explains `r round((tmod1.0.0 %>% summary() %>%.[["adj.r.squared"]])*100,1)`% of the variance (Model 1). After adding the prior beliefs variables decision manipulation (Model 4), the explained variance is almost doubled ($Adj.R^2$ = `r round((tmod1.0.3 %>% summary() %>%.[["adj.r.squared"]]),3)`. For the expertise aspect, the increase in $Adj.R^2$ is even more substantial, from `r round((tmod2.0.0 %>% summary() %>%.[["adj.r.squared"]]),3)` to `r round((tmod2.0.3 %>% summary() %>%.[["adj.r.squared"]]),3)`. Finally, for the commitment dimension, perceived independence explains only `r round((tmod3.0.0 %>% summary() %>%.[["adj.r.squared"]]*100),1)`% of the variation, and adding the decision manipulation increases that to `r round((tmod3.0.1 %>% summary() %>%.[["adj.r.squared"]]*100),1)`%. Thereafter, after adding support for pesticides and their interaction with the decision, it increases slightly, but significantly, to `r round((tmod3.0.3 %>% summary() %>%.[["adj.r.squared"]]*100),1)`%. 

In sum, our observational analyses suggest that whereas perceptions about independence are associated with greater credibility, the effect is strong only with respect to the considerations aspect. For the two other dimensions, the effect is significant, yet quite moderate. At the same time, stakeholders' pre-determined perceptions play an important, and perhaps even greater role in shaping credibility, and mainly the exclusion of non-professional considerations and the quality of the decision.

## *Experimental measure for independence* 
We now turn to our experimental examination of the effect of perceived independence. To reiterate, we manipulated the perceived independence of EFSA by randomly assigning participants to treatment and control conditions. We utilize this random allocation and treat it as an instrumental variable.

`r table.x=table.x+1`**Table `r table.x`** compares the perceived independence and the three credibility aspects between the control and treatment conditions. The first row shows the differences in perceived personal relevance (*the first stage*), which we already reported in the methods section. Thereafter, for each of the three credibility aspects, we show the raw differences between the two groups (*the reduced form*) and then the instrumental variable (IV) estimate. The reduced form can be interpreted as the causal effect of priming stakeholders about the independence of EFSA. The IV estimate, which equals to the difference in credibility divided by the difference in perceived independence, represents the effect of perceived independence attributed to the manipulation. 

The findings reveal that the participants assigned to the independence treatment condition reported, on average, higher values for all three aspects (reduced form), yet these differences are significant only in relation to the considerations aspect (*p* = `r (t.test(credibility.pest.considerations~treatment,efsa_00 %>% drop_na(independence.polit.efsa))[["p.value"]]/2) %>% round(3)`, one-tailed test).

We further run OLS and 2SLS instrumental variable regression analysis for the three dimension. These analyses provide a more accurate estimate, by controlling for covariates and estimating the statistical uncertainty `r table.x=table.x+1`**Table `r table.x`** shows the results of these models. All models control for same covariates in the models presented above. Again, through IV analysis, we identify with sufficient confidence only the causal effect of perceived independence on the considerations aspect. The 2SLS model (Model 3) predicts that a one standard deviation increase in perceived independence *causes* an increase of `r iv.t1.std %>% round(2)` standard deviations increase in considerations dimension.
